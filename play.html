        <h3>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS by HERMANN SUDERMANN</h3>
        <p><h5 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN</h5><p class="speech FRAU LINDEMANN">There! Now she can come--curtains.</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="ROSA">ROSA</h5><p class="speech ROSA">Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN</h5><p class="direction">[_Indignantly._]</p> What? What do you mean by that!</p>
        <p><h5 class="ROSA">ROSA</h5><p class="speech ROSA">I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an
            inn like this</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN</h5><p class="speech FRAU LINDEMANN">Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;
            that the letter is a forgery?</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="ROSA">ROSA</h5><p class="speech ROSA">Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke.<p class="direction">[_Giggles._]</p></p></p>
        <p><h5 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN</h5><p class="speech FRAU LINDEMANN">When Herr Str√ºbel makes a joke he makes a decent joke, a
            real, genuine joke.</p></p>
